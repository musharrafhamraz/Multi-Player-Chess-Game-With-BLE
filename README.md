# Multiplayer Chess Using Bluetooth in Flutter

This project is a Flutter-based mobile application for playing chess between two players using Bluetooth connectivity. The app enables seamless peer-to-peer communication, allowing players to host or join games without the need for an internet connection. The core features include a visually intuitive chessboard, turn-based gameplay, move validation, and handling of game disruptions like disconnections or reconnections.

Bluetooth integration is achieved using the `flutter_blue_plus` package, while the `chess` Dart package manages chess rules, move validation, and game state logic. Players can synchronize their moves in real-time, ensuring a smooth gaming experience. Additional features like timed games, player statistics, and leaderboards can be implemented to enhance the appâ€™s functionality.

With a focus on user experience, the app provides a clean interface, clear game flow, and error handling for common issues. The project is designed with modularity in mind, ensuring scalability and ease of maintenance. It is an excellent starting point for developers interested in building Bluetooth-based multiplayer games.
